This 2D King Of Fighters-esque fighting game, implemented in Verilog for the
DE2-115 FPGA, was designed for the final project of ECE 287 (Digital Systems
Design) at Miami University.

This project contains the `.qpf` and `.qsf` files needed for Intel's Quartus
Prime software.  Before compiling, the `./build_assets` script should be run to
generate Verilog modules for the project assets (images, etc.).

### File Contents

#### Verilog Files

- `fighting_game.v` (**root module**): This module combines the graphical modules, input modules, and game logic modules and serves as the root module for this project.
- `graphics.v`: This module provides the VGA controller and handles sprite rendering.
- `image_*.v`: These modules are auto-generated by the `png_to_v` Python script in `utils/`, and provide RGBA values for given X/Y pixel coordinates.
- `utils.v`: This module contains utility modules such as counters, registers, etc.
- `vga.v`: This module provides the VGA timings and sync controls.

#### Quartus Prime Files

- `digital-design-project.qpf`: This file contains Quartus Prime project information and is the file that should be imported into Quartus.
- `fighting_game.qsf`: This file contains assignment information for the Quartus project.

#### Other Files

- `build_assets`: This script will construct all Verilog modules for assets needed by the project (i.e. it calls `png_to_v` to convert image assets)
